# Overview
Generative AI or RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) applications.

## Problem
Solving problem of the specific domain, like knowledge of the organizations or industries, is hard.

Generic Large Language Model is traied with the publicly available information.

## Solution

### Inference time
RAG for new information LLM doesn't know.

### Training time
RAFT: Finetuning with dataset generated by RAG.

## Uniquness and Goal

1. RAG for generating dataset for fine tuning

2. RAG for retrieval

3. Solving problem of specific domain

## Requirement
### Environment and technology

Red Hat OpenShift AI environment

Intel OpenVINO

Intel Xeon Processor AMX feature

### Deliverables
Include a demonstration video of the Project made publicly visible on YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook Video, or Youku

  Video should be around three minutes
  
  Video should include footage that shows the Project functioning on the device for which it was built

Include at least one test script to demonstrate the Project functionality

Include a screenshot capturing the results of the test script showcasing the use of the Intel OpenVINO model server for inference.

Include a screenshot showcasing the underlying platform supporting the Intel Xeon Processor AMX feature.
